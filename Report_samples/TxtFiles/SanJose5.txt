B.  Government Code Section 65402 does not apply to this vacation; and 
 
C.  The proposed vacation is consistent with the City’s General Plan; and 
 
D.  The Subject Property is unnecessary for nonmotorized transportation 
as bordering rights-of-way are available and more suitable for such 
transportation; and  
 
E.  There are no in-place public utility facilities located within the Subject Property 
that would be affected by the proposed vacation; and 
 
F.  The public convenience and necessity does not require the 
reservation of a public service easement; and 
 
G.  The Subject Property is not needed for, nor adaptable to, municipal 
purposes, and the public interest would be served by the sale of such 
surplus real property; and 
 
H.  The proposed sale of the Subject Property conforms to Cal. Gov. 
Code §54221(f)(1)(B) in that the size of the surplus Subject Property 
is less than 5,000 square feet in area, is being sold to an owner of 
contiguous land, and, as such, should be declared “exempt surplus 
land”; and 
 
I.  The proposed sale of the Subject Property also conforms to San José 
Municipal Code §4.20.070(A)/(B) in that both sales are to an adjacent 
property owner, not independently developable, and would limit the 
City’s liability as well as reduce future ongoing maintenance 
obligations.
