BACKGROUND

Committee regarding proposed City Council sponsored Special Events and the proposed

Silicon Valley Pride first began back in 1975 as a gay rights rally and evolved into the 
San José Pride Festival in 1976. During the following year, in 1977, San José added its 
first pride parade to the celebration. In 2014, the San José Pride Festival transformed 
once again into Silicon Valley Pride so that the organization could foster a greater sense 
of unity amongst San José’s neighboring cities.  
 
This Pride Festival is now the largest Pride celebration of the entire South Bay 
community and is an inclusive family friendly event that everyone can enjoy, typically 
taking place in Downtown San José. It is because of this festival that the Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer communities and its abundant allies may celebrate 
their lives loudly and proudly by marching, dancing, and singing together.  
 
Due to the proliferation of COVID-19 throughout our community, typical in-person Pride 
parades and festivals were unable to occur. Amid a worldwide pandemic, Silicon Valley 
Pride had continued to digitally serve our community by providing an array of COVID-
19 community support resources and hosting online social events. Most notable of their 
virtual events was the “45th Annual Silicon Valley Pride Celebration: Equality Rising,” a 
2-day digital festival that took place the last weekend of August 2020. They showcased 
talent across the queer and ally community, virtual access to merchants and non-profits 
from across the area. People showed their pride by submitting 1-minute video clips. 
 
Silicon Valley Pride is back in-person this year to celebrate the annual LGBTQ+ Parade 
and Festival on Saturday, August 28, 2021, and Sunday, August 29, 2021. This year’s 
theme is Standing for Love and Liberation. The LGBTQ+ community will be setting up 
their festival in the Plaza de César Chávez Park in downtown San José to celebrate the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
 
To honor Silicon Valley Pride and their extraordinary work, City Hall shall raise the 
Rainbow Flag (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) and Bisexual Flag (pink, 
blue, and purple) from August 24-31, 2021. City Hall Tower shall light up in 
rainbow/pride themed colors from August 24-31, 2021 and City Hall Rotunda shall light 
up in transgender themed colors from August 24-27, 2021 and August 29-31, 2021.  
 
ANALYSIS  
The raising of the Rainbow and Bisexual Flags are permitted under Council Policy 2-1, 
Section C.3 — Flags Displayed in Conjunction with Official Ceremonial Items: “Other 
flags may be displayed in conjunction with official actions, ceremonial items, or 
proclamations of the City Council. City Council Policy 7-14, City Hall Event Lighting 
Policy, Sections B.1 and C.1 allows Rotunda and Tower lighting in conjunction 
with proclamations for official actions or ceremonial items as approved by City Council. 
Approval by the City Council of the event will ensure compliance with the Council’s 
prior direction regarding Council Special Events. In observance of existing fundraising 
disclosure requirements, Councilmember Pam Foley and Councilmember Dev Davis will 
report any cash or in-kind donations received for the event on their Disclosure of 
Fundraising Report (DFR-1). Approval of this memorandum will enable Council District 
9 and 6, City departments and the Office of the City Clerk to proceed with the event. Any 
     
      
 
cash donations received will be processed pursuant to the City’s normal financial and 
budgetary procedures. 
 
PUBLIC OUTREACH/INTEREST  
The Office of the City Clerk will post the item on the City’s Website for the July 28, 
2021 Rules Committee Agenda and the August 24, 2021 City Council Agenda.
