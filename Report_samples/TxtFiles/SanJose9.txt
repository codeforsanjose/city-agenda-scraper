Report (Resolution No.   
75309), File No. PDC09-004  8/10/21 
SUBJECT:  APPROVE AN ORDINANCE DEDICATING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC RIGHT- OF-
WAY AS PART OF COLEMAN AVENUE, CHAMPIONS WAY, WONDO WAY, 
EARTHQUAKES WAY, AND AVIATION AVENUE 
RECOMMENDATION: 
Approve an ordinance dedicating as public right-of-way approximately 299,336 square feet of City-owned 
property along the south side of Coleman Avenue and the newly constructed streets named Champions Way, 
Wondo Way, Aviation Avenue, and Earthquakes Way and accepting the newly dedicated rights-of-way into 
the City’s street system as named above in conjunction with the PayPal Park stadium and the Coleman 
Highline Development Projects (“Projects”). 
 
BASIS FOR RECOMMENDATION: 
On August 19, 2003, City Council adopted the FMC/Coleman Avenue EIR via Resolution No. 71716 and on 
March 16, 2010, City Council adopted the Airport West and Great Oaks Place EIR (collectively, “EIR’s”) 
via Resolution No. 73509.  The EIR’s included a masterplan to construct 3 million square feet of Office 
R&D and an 18,000 seat sports stadium on property generally bounded by Coleman Avenue to the north, 
Newhall Street to the east, Lands of VTA to the south, and the City of Santa Clara to the west, as shown in 
the attached location map.  
 
A significant component of the EIRs for the Coleman Highline and PayPal Park Stadium Developments 
includes the widening of Coleman Avenue from the City of Santa Clara boundary line to PayPal Park 
stadium, and the construction of new public streets, namely Earthquakes Way, Wondo Way, Aviation 
Avenue, and Champions Way (collectively, “New Public Streets”).   
 
After approval of the Projects, the City entered into several public improvement agreements with the 
developers for the Projects that required the construction of right-of-way improvements. These right-of-way 
improvements are now complete, or nearing completion, and staff recommends dedicating the New Public 
Streets and accepting them into the City’s street system. 
   
The recommended ordinance would align the public rights-of-way on Coleman Avenue, Earthquakes Way, 
Wondo Way, Aviation Avenue, and Champions Way with the actual physical improvements constructed 
pursuant to the public improvement agreements. 
 
Climate Smart San Jose:  The recommendation in this memo has no effect on Climate Smart San José energy, 
water, or mobility goals. 
 
Commission Recommendation/Input: No commission recommendation or input is associated with this action. 
 
 
 COST AND FUNDING SOURCE: 
There is no purchase cost to the City establishing City-owned property as part of the public right-of-way. 
Once accepted into the City’s street system, the City will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of 
the New Public Streets.
