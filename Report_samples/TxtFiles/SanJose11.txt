On February 1, 2005, the City Council adopted Resolution 72517 which requires

Council sponsored Special Events and the proposed use of any funds. 
The 15th Annual Santos Family Car Show will be held on September 4, 2021 at 5202 N. First 
Street, Alviso, CA 95002 from 8:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. and is sponsored by Councilmember David 
Cohen. This special event highlights an extensive array of vintage and classic cars from around 
the Bay Area. Many car enthusiasts arrive before 5:00 a.m. for prime parking along North First 
Street, Alviso’s main thoroughfare, as neighboring streets and parking lots tend to fill up with 
classic cars, trucks, and hot rods. The atmosphere is festive and vibrant, with classic 
hits from the 1950s setting the tone and vendors scattered throughout, selling auto parts, arts & 
crafts, food, jewelry, and more. It has been sponsored and organized by the Santos family since 
its inception, and is free and open to the public. The District 4 sponsorship of this community 
event is intended to attract visitors to Alviso and for residents to discover the Alviso Marina 
along with area restaurants and amenities. HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL
