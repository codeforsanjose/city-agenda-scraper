</p>
<p>community’s expectations by providing excellent service, in a positive and timely manner, and in the 
</p>
<p>full view of the public. 
</p>
<p>Welcome to the San José City Council meeting! 
</p>
<p>This Agenda contains both a Consent Calendar section for routine business items that require Council 
</p>
<p>approval, and general business items arranged to correspond with San José’s City Service Areas (CSAs). 
</p>
<p>City Service Areas represent the policy-making level for strategic planning, policy setting, and investment 
</p>
<p>decisions in the critical functions the City provides to the community. They are: 
</p>
<p>• Strategic Support - The internal functions that enable the CSAs to provide direct 
</p>
<p>   services to the community in an effective and efficient manner.
</p>
<p>• Public Safety - Commitment to excellence in public safety by investing in neighborhood 
</p>
<p>  partnerships as well as prevention, enforcement, and emergency preparedness services.
</p>
<p>• Transportation &amp; Aviation Services - A safe and efficient transportation system that contributes to 
</p>
<p>  the livability and economic health of the City; and provide for the air transportation needs of the 
</p>
<p>  community and the region at levels that is acceptable to the community.
</p>
<p>• Environmental and Utility Services - Manage environmental services and utility systems to ensure 
</p>
<p>  a sustainable environment for the community.   
</p>
<p>• Neighborhood Services - Serve, foster, and strengthen community by providing access to lifelong 
</p>
<p>   learning and opportunities to enjoy life.  
</p>
<p>• Community &amp; Economic Development - Manage the growth and change of the community in 
</p>
<p>   order to create and preserve healthy neighborhoods and ensure a diverse range of employment and 
</p>
<p>   housing opportunities.
</p>
<p>You may speak to the City Council about any discussion item that is on the agenda, and you may also speak 
</p>
<p>during Open Forum on items that are not on the agenda and are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the 
</p>
<p>City Council or Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency Board. If you wish to speak to the City 
</p>
<p>Council, please refer to the following guidelines:
</p>
<p>o Fill out a Yellow Speaker’s Card and submit it to the City Clerk seated at the front table. Do 
</p>
<p>   this before the meeting or before the item is heard. This will ensure that your name is called for 
</p>
<p>   the item(s) that you wish to address, and it will help ensure the meeting runs smoothly for all 
</p>
<p>   participants. 
</p>
<p>o When the Council reaches your item on the agenda, the Mayor will open the public hearing and call 
</p>
<p>   your name. Please address the Council from the podium, which is located to the left of the City 
</p>
<p>   Clerk’s table. </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>o Each speaker generally has two minutes to speak per item. The amount of time allotted to 
</p>
<p>     speakers may vary at the Mayor’s discretion, depending on the number of speakers or the length 
</p>
<p>     of the agenda. 
</p>
<p>o To assist you in tracking your speaking time, there is a display on the podium. The green light 
</p>
<p>     turns on when you begin speaking; the yellow light turns on when you have 30 seconds left; and 
</p>
<p>     the red light turns on when your speaking time is up. 
</p>
<p>Please be advised that, by law, the City Council is unable to discuss or take action on issues presented during 
</p>
<p>Open Forum. According to State Law (the Brown Act) items must first be noticed on the agenda before any 
</p>
<p>discussion or action.
</p>
<p>The San José City Council meets every Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 6 p.m. as needed, 
</p>
<p>unless otherwise noted.  The City Council, or less than a quorum, may adjourn any regular, special 
</p>
<p>or adjourned meeting to a later date, time and place specified in the order of adjournment.  If all 
</p>
<p>members are absent, the City Clerk may declare the meeting adjourned to a stated date, time and 
</p>
<p>place. If you have any questions, please direct them to the City Clerk’s staff seated at the tables 
</p>
<p>just below the dais.  Thank you for taking the time to attend today’s meeting.  We look forward to
